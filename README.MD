# Default Improved HUD
Default Improved HUD is the UI mod for Team Fortress 2 with main focus on code cleanup and adding handy fixes.

# Features:
On initial release:
- Improved code legibility with focus on code cleaniness and code minimalism (significant file size reductions)
- Minimalistic Killstreak count for Minimal HUD (replaces killstreak label with killstreak icon)
- Fixed Spell Book spell count cutting off at the bottom and tweaked spell book image to appear in Minimal HUD
- Transparent spectator top and bottom borders
- Fixed ping count in scoreboard that has been broken in the recent Team Fortress 2 update
- Adjusted taunt menu number buttons to match PDA menu number buttons
- Tweaked ammunition interface to be more unified and tweaked ammo counts to not cut off on panel ends
- Demoman stickybombs interface only appears when a stickybomb exists in Minimal HUD
- Medigun interface improvements: adjusted Vaccinator icons to be inside of the medigun interface border and adjusted Vaccinator charges alignment alongside with it
- Made Damage count more legible ‒ usage of larger font for normal DMG and even larger font for critical DMG
- Now Eureka Effect interface matches to the design of PDA menu interface
